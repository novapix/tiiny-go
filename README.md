# TIINY
- Shorten your long URLs in just a click.
- A url shortner made using Bootstrap, Redis and Go.
- Simple, Minimalist and Fast


## [ORIGINAL REPO](https://github.com/viperadnan-git/tiiny)
## Changes from Original Repo
- Rewrite the entire backend in Go
- Use Redis as Database (30 Day TTL)
- Add Docker Deployment
## Why this fork ?
I needed a simple URL Shortener that just works, No User account, No extra fuss. Tiiny existed but it was solely reliant on Deta which has been shutdown. So I decided to rewrite in Go and use Redis as Database
